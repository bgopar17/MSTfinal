# MSTfinal

Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm 

Sample Graph:
Graph has 9 vertices and the following edges (with weights):

Input:
0-1 (4), 0-7 (8), 1-2 (8), 1-7 (11), 2-3 (7), 2-5 (4), 2-8 (2),
3-4 (9), 3-5 (14), 4-5 (10), 5-6 (2), 6-7 (1), 6-8 (6), 7-8 (7)

Output:
Edges in MST:
0 - 1 (Weight: 4)
0 - 7 (Weight: 8)
7 - 6 (Weight: 1)
6 - 5 (Weight: 2)
5 - 2 (Weight: 4)
2 - 8 (Weight: 2)
2 - 3 (Weight: 7)
3 - 4 (Weight: 9)
Total Weight of MST: 37
